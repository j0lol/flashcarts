TTDS Launcher - v1.0 - Apache Thunder 3/14/2015
Build of YSMenu included: v7.04

This is the first confirmed working launcher for the DSTT! Specifically, this launches YSMenu.

However it should boot other kernels. WoodTT I've personally tested as working. But other kernels remain untested.

I've included the firmware files I've personally tested and confirmed working on a genuine DSTT.
Some R4 SDHC cards may work with this too as they are mostly clones of the DSTT.


To install, copy TTMenu folder and TTMenu.dat to MicroSD of your DSTT.

Then install the TTDS_Launcher.cia on your 3DS. Use this to launch your DSTT. Remember, like my past launchers patched
TWL_FIRM is required to launch the Stage2 launcher. Use a nightly build of rxTools (something NEWER then 3.0 beta2!)
or a prepatched TWL_FIRM cia. n3DS users must use prepatched TWL_FIRM CIA as rxTools does not yet supprot TWL patches
on n3DS.

Enjoy!
